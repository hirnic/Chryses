This is my temporary To-Do list.
1. Fix Font (Not pressing. Actually, it looks like I figured it all out.)
2. Convert resource settings page to TreeView (Not pressing).
3. Fix building energy prices (Maybe. It seems more fun the way it currently is...)
4. Implement battle mechanics.
5. Solve deuterium problem (doesn't decrease when above storage capacity).
6. Fix placeholder issues.
7. DEATHTRAP .owner attribute (should be .ownerName).
8. Make a better system for the label names, button names, etc.
9.  Make production queue show all things in queue.
10. Clean the code! There are very few comments and there are warnings everywhere.
11. When the user gets more than 4 planets, there will be issues. Update the overview.
12. Implement cancelMission function.
13. Format Espionage Report
14. Display Save Game Message
